Unlike the emperors of old, whose legitimacy rested on the fragile Mandate of Heaven, the Chakravartin's rule is derived from the Dharma itself—unchanging, eternal, and beyond question. As the Wheel-Turning Monarch, the Chakravartin does not merely govern; he guides all under heaven toward enlightenment, enforcing righteousness through both wisdom and power. This system of governance retains the administrative structures of the Middle Kingdom, allowing for efficient rule over vast lands while ensuring that all officials act in accordance with Buddhist principles. The Chakravartin reigns as both sovereign and spiritual protector, his authority uniting monastic orders, state officials, and military forces under a single divine purpose. No longer bound by the cycles of rise and fall, the empire stands as a beacon of Dharma, unyielding and everlasting."
