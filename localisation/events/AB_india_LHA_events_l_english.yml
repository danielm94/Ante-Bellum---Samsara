 ab_india_lha_events.1.t:0 "The Bon Hold on Lhasa"
 ab_india_lha_events.1.d:0 "Though our rule extends over the sacred city of Lhasa, the people within its walls remain bound to the old ways. The temples of Bon still stand, their rituals continuing much as they have for centuries. Even as Vajrayana Buddhism spreads across the land, the devotion of Lhasa’s people to their ancestral faith remains unshaken. Some whisper that the monastic order has failed in its duty, that the ancient gods of the plateau still hold sway in the hearts of the people.\nFor generations, Bon priests have maintained their influence through deep local ties, an understanding of the land, and the sheer force of tradition. Attempts at conversion have been slow, resisted by both the common folk and noble families who see no reason to abandon the gods of their forebears. While our monks rule in name, their word carries little weight among a people who do not recognize their faith.\nIf we are to make Lhasa the true spiritual heart of our realm, we must find a way to break the grip of the old faith—or else accept coexistence, no matter how uneasy it may be."

 ab_india_lha_events.4.t:0 "In Search of the Dalai Lama"
 ab_india_lha_events.4.d:0 "For centuries, the teachings of the Buddha have guided the people of Tibet, yet a true spiritual leader has not yet risen to unify and protect the faith. The Gelug school has long prophesied the coming of an enlightened soul, a reincarnation of Avalokitesvara himself—the Dalai Lama. If we are to solidify our rule and ensure the future of our faith, we must embark on a sacred quest to find this reincarnation and bring him under our guidance. The search will be arduous and require resources, but the rewards for Tibet and all Vajrayana Buddhism will be immeasurable."

 ab_india_lha_events.5.t:0 "The Rebirth of the Dalai Lama"
 ab_india_lha_events.5.d:0 "After years of searching across the vast plateaus and hidden valleys of Tibet, our monks have returned with momentous news—the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama has been found. The child, bearing the signs foretold in sacred texts, has been recognized by the most esteemed lamas of the Gelug school. Already, whispers of his divine wisdom spread through the streets of Lhasa, as pilgrims and scholars alike gather to witness the return of their spiritual leader. Yet, not all rejoice at this revelation. Some within the old noble families grumble at the thought of another holy ruler rising to power, while the rival sects of Tibet watch with wary eyes. Even beyond our borders, foreign powers take note, aware that the Dalai Lama’s presence could shift the balance of influence in the region. Nevertheless, for the faithful, this is a moment of divine affirmation—the wheel of Dharma turns once more, and Tibet shall be guided by the wisdom of the Dalai Lama."

 ab_india_lha_events.8.t:0 "The Lords’ Rebellion"
 ab_india_lha_events.8.d:0 "For centuries, the noble families of Tibet have ruled their domains with autonomy, their influence stretching far beyond their mountain fortresses. Though they have long tolerated the monastic orders and their spiritual authority, our relentless search for the Dalai Lama has threatened to upend the balance of power. Whispers in the halls of noble estates turn to open defiance, as lords and clan leaders fear that the enthronement of a divinely ordained ruler will strip them of their ancestral rights. Now, the unrest has escalated to outright rebellion."
 ab_india_lha_events.8.a:0 "Crush the rebels! No man stands above the Dharma!"
 ab_india_lha_events.9.t:0 "Sectarian Strife in Communities"
 ab_india_lha_events.9.d:0 "Tensions between the Gelug school and the Nyingma school have erupted into violence in several communities. What began as heated debates in monasteries has spilled into the streets, where monks and laypeople alike have taken up arms in defense of their beliefs. The Gelug reformists, emboldened by state patronage, have begun denouncing the practices of the older Nyingma tradition, calling them outdated and impure. In response, Nyingma adherents have refused to yield, accusing the Gelug monks of arrogance and overreach. Clashes have broken out, sacred texts have been burned, and rival monasteries now barricade themselves in fear of further attacks. If order is not restored, the conflict could spiral beyond control, threatening the fragile unity of the land."
 ab_india_lha_events.9.a:0 "We're kind of in the middle of something here!"
 ab_india_lha_events.10.t:0 "Defiance of the Landowners"
 ab_india_lha_events.10.d:0 "As the state devotes its resources to the grand search for the Dalai Lama, the great landowning families of Tibet have quietly begun asserting their independence. With the monastic authorities focused on spiritual matters, tax shipments have slowed, and in some regions, they have stopped entirely. Local rulers, emboldened by the absence of oversight, have begun acting as sovereign lords in their own right—settling disputes, raising small militias, and ignoring edicts from Lhasa. While some see this as a temporary shift, others fear that, if left unchecked, these landowners may permanently undermine the authority of the central government."
 ab_india_lha_events.10.a:0 "We'll deal with them later..."
 ab_india_lha_events.11.t:0 "The Monastic Council Assumes Power"
 ab_india_lha_events.11.d:0 "With the discovery of the Sacred Child, the Dalai Lama, a Monastic Council has been established to oversee the administration of the state until he comes of age. The young Dalai Lama is to be raised and educated within the monastery, meticulously prepared for the great responsibility of spiritual and temporal leadership that awaits him. However, the abrupt shift in power dynamics has caused unrest among the nobility and common folk alike. As the Council consolidates control, uncertainty and unease have spread across Tibet, raising tensions and threatening stability. The Council must decide which skills the young Dalai Lama should focus on during his education—whether administrative, diplomatic, or military—to best prepare him to lead our nation into a prosperous future."
 ab_india_lha_events.11.tooltip:0 "§YThe negative modifier will be removed once the Dalai Lama assumes power.§!"
 ab_india_lha_events.11.a:0 "He shall master the arts of governance and spiritual administration!"
 ab_india_lha_events.11.b:0 "Teach him the ways of diplomacy and the subtleties of statecraft!"
 ab_india_lha_events.11.c:0 "Train him rigorously in martial tradition; he must defend our faith!"
 ab_india_lha_events.12.t:0 "The Ascension of the Dalai Lama"
 ab_india_lha_events.12.d:0 "The years of careful tutelage and spiritual preparation have come to an end. The sacred child, recognized as the reincarnation of the Bodhisattva of Compassion, has now come of age, ready to assume his rightful place as both the spiritual and temporal ruler of our land. From the halls of the monastery where he was shaped by the wisdom of the greatest scholars and monks, he now steps forth to guide our nation with divine insight. The Monastic Council relinquishes its authority, placing the future of Tibet in the hands of the Dalai Lama. The people rejoice, yet the weight of expectation is immense. His rule will be a test of faith, wisdom, and governance. Will he usher in an era of peace and enlightenment, or will his reign be marked by the trials of unifying a land long divided?\n\nThus begins a new chapter in the history of Tibet. Under his guidance, the Ganden Phodrang shall rise, carrying forth the legacy of dharma and righteousness."

 ab_india_lha_events.13.t:0 "Choosing Our Steppe Ally"
 ab_india_lha_events.13.desc:0 "The vast steppes of Central Asia are home to powerful Oirat khanates, each with its own ambitions and rivalries. Though the influence of the Buddhist faith has reached their lands, they remain deeply tied to their nomadic traditions and Tengri beliefs. Our envoys have spent months fostering goodwill among the Oirats, and now the time has come to decide where our loyalties shall lie."
 ab_india_lha_events.13.a:0 "With the Khoshuud Khanate."

 ab_india_lha_events.15.t:0 "The Tibetanization of China"
 ab_india_lha_events.15.d:0 "With the conquest of southern China, our language, faith, and customs have begun to take root, spreading from the peaks of the Himalayas to the fertile plains of the Middle Kingdom. The people, long divided by the chaos of war, now find unity under the Dharma, embracing the wisdom of our rule. Yet, not all are willing to cast aside their old ways—pockets of resistance remain, clinging to traditions that once led them to ruin. It will take time, patience, and the guidance of the sangha to bring true enlightenment to all.\n\n§RChinese culture group provinces in China that follow the Vajrayana faith will begin adopting the Gya culture, reflecting their integration into our sacred order. Likewise, Tai culture group provinces will shift toward Bai culture. Provinces that have been developed 3 times, have ports, have taxation buildings, or have courthouse buildings are more likely to embrace this transformation.§!"
 ab_india_lha_events.15.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 ab_india_lha_events.16.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 ab_india_lha_events.16.d:0 "   With the fall of the Yuan and the conquest of Pecing, the rule of the Dharma has been secured over the lands of the Gya. What was once the stronghold of Mongol tyranny has now been reshaped into a seat of wisdom, where the echoes of war have been replaced by the chanting of monks. For the first time in history, a Tibetan ruler presides over the Middle Kingdom, offering guidance not through force alone, but through the eternal light of the Dharma.\n   Yet, a question now looms over the court. For centuries, Lhasa has been the spiritual heart of our people, the seat of the Dalai Lama, and the center from which the Dharma spreads. But governing an empire as vast as this from the heights of the Himalayas is no simple task. The roads are treacherous, the winters are bitter, and the vast plains of The Middle Kingdom remain distant from the halls of Lhasa. Some among our advisors whisper that Pecing, a city built for the governance of the Middle Kingdom, should become our new capital—a place from which the Dharma can be spread across all of The Middle Kingdom with ease. The Forbidden City has already been reforged into the Pecing Potala, a grand palace where Tibetan artisans and Gya craftsmen have labored to make it fit for a ruler of both worlds.\n   But to move the capital would be to abandon centuries of tradition, forsaking Lhasa as the heart of our realm. To some, such a decision would be unthinkable. To others, it is the only path forward. The question now stands before us—shall we continue to rule from our sacred city in the mountains, or shall we descend to Pecing and govern from the heart of our new dominion?"
 ab_india_lha_events.16.a:0 "Lhasa is the Seat of the Faith. We shall remain."
 ab_india_lha_events.16.b:0 "Pecing is the center of The Middle Kingdom. We shall rule from there."
