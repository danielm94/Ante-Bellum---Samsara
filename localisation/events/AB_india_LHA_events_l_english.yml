 ab_india_lha_events.1.d:0 "Though our rule extends over the sacred city of Lhasa, the people within its walls remain bound to the old ways. The temples of Bon still stand, their rituals continuing much as they have for centuries. Even as Vajrayana Buddhism spreads across the land, the devotion of Lhasa’s people to their ancestral faith remains unshaken. Some whisper that the monastic order has failed in its duty, that the ancient gods of the plateau still hold sway in the hearts of the people.\nFor generations, Bon priests have maintained their influence through deep local ties, an understanding of the land, and the sheer force of tradition. Attempts at conversion have been slow, resisted by both the common folk and noble families who see no reason to abandon the gods of their forebears. While our monks rule in name, their word carries little weight among a people who do not recognize their faith.\nIf we are to make Lhasa the true spiritual heart of our realm, we must find a way to break the grip of the old faith—or else accept coexistence, no matter how uneasy it may be."

 ab_india_lha_events.2.d:0 "We have unlocked the 'Legacy of Trisong Detsen' timed mission. If we complete this mission before the year 1460, we will unlock a powerful bonus. Should we fail, the mission will be §Rpermanently removed§! from our mission tree."
 ab_india_lha_events.2.a:0 "We must act quickly!"

 ab_india_lha_events.4.t:0 "In Search of the Dalai Lama"
 ab_india_lha_events.4.d:0 "For centuries, the teachings of the Buddha have guided the people of Tibet, yet a true spiritual leader has not yet risen to unify and protect the faith. The Gelug school has long prophesied the coming of an enlightened soul, a reincarnation of Avalokitesvara himself—the Dalai Lama. If we are to solidify our rule and ensure the future of our faith, we must embark on a sacred quest to find this reincarnation and bring him under our guidance. The search will be arduous and require resources, but the rewards for Tibet and all Vajrayana Buddhism will be immeasurable."
 ab_india_lha_events.4.tooltip:0 "These modifiers will be removed once we find the Dalai Lama."
 ab_india_lha_events.4.c.tooltip:0 "No immediate penalties will be applied, but it will take longer to find the Dalai Lama, which may have undesirable concequences..."

 ab_india_lha_events.4.c:0 "The Dalai Lama will be revealed to us in time."
 ab_india_lha_events.5.t:0 "The Rebirth of the Dalai Lama"
 ab_india_lha_events.5.d:0 "After years of searching across the vast plateaus and hidden valleys of Tibet, our monks have returned with momentous news—the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama has been found. The child, bearing the signs foretold in sacred texts, has been recognized by the most esteemed lamas of the Gelug school. Already, whispers of his divine wisdom spread through the streets of Lhasa, as pilgrims and scholars alike gather to witness the return of their spiritual leader. Yet, not all rejoice at this revelation. Some within the old noble families grumble at the thought of another holy ruler rising to power, while the rival sects of Tibet watch with wary eyes. Even beyond our borders, foreign powers take note, aware that the Dalai Lama’s presence could shift the balance of influence in the region. Nevertheless, for the faithful, this is a moment of divine affirmation—the wheel of Dharma turns once more, and Tibet shall be guided by the wisdom of the Dalai Lama."

 ab_india_lha_events.8.t:0 "The Lords’ Rebellion"
 ab_india_lha_events.8.d:0 "For centuries, the noble families of Tibet have ruled their domains with autonomy, their influence stretching far beyond their mountain fortresses. Though they have long tolerated the monastic orders and their spiritual authority, our relentless search for the Dalai Lama has threatened to upend the balance of power. Whispers in the halls of noble estates turn to open defiance, as lords and clan leaders fear that the enthronement of a divinely ordained ruler will strip them of their ancestral rights. Now, the unrest has escalated to outright rebellion."
 ab_india_lha_events.8.a:0 "Crush the rebels! No man stands above the Dharma!"
 ab_india_lha_events.9.t:0 "Sectarian Strife in Communities"
 ab_india_lha_events.9.d:0 "Tensions between the Gelug school and the Nyingma school have erupted into violence in several communities. What began as heated debates in monasteries has spilled into the streets, where monks and laypeople alike have taken up arms in defense of their beliefs. The Gelug reformists, emboldened by state patronage, have begun denouncing the practices of the older Nyingma tradition, calling them outdated and impure. In response, Nyingma adherents have refused to yield, accusing the Gelug monks of arrogance and overreach. Clashes have broken out, sacred texts have been burned, and rival monasteries now barricade themselves in fear of further attacks. If order is not restored, the conflict could spiral beyond control, threatening the fragile unity of the land."
 ab_india_lha_events.9.a:0 "We're kind of in the middle of something here!"
 ab_india_lha_events.10.t:0 "Defiance of the Landowners"
 ab_india_lha_events.10.d:0 "As the state devotes its resources to the grand search for the Dalai Lama, the great landowning families of Tibet have quietly begun asserting their independence. With the monastic authorities focused on spiritual matters, tax shipments have slowed, and in some regions, they have stopped entirely. Local rulers, emboldened by the absence of oversight, have begun acting as sovereign lords in their own right—settling disputes, raising small militias, and ignoring edicts from Lhasa. While some see this as a temporary shift, others fear that, if left unchecked, these landowners may permanently undermine the authority of the central government."
 ab_india_lha_events.10.a:0 "We'll deal with them later..."
