 lha_sword_and_dharma_desc:0 "For too long, the sacred land of Tibet has been fractured, plagued by internal struggles and foreign influences. Though we are monks, we are also guardians of the faith. Under the guidance of our spiritual leaders, we must prepare our forces, for only through unity—both of mind and of strength—can we ensure the security of our monasteries and people. If we do not take up arms to protect the Dharma, who will?"

 lha_pacify_the_old_faith_desc:0 "The western regions of Tibet remain lost in the old ways, clinging to the teachings of Bön. Though our faith has spread far, many still follow the ancient rites and resist the truth of the Dharma. If we are to unify Tibet, we must bring the wayward western lords under our guidance—through diplomacy, faith, or force. Only then can Tibet truly be whole."
 lha_unite_the_faithful_title:0 "Unite the Faithful"
 lha_unite_the_faithful_desc:0 "The eastern reaches of Tibet remain fragmented, divided between Vajrayana Buddhist warlords and scattered tribal chieftains. Though they follow the Dharma, their ambitions and rivalries keep them divided. To truly unify Tibet, we must show them the wisdom of a single, united faith under Lhasa’s guidance. Only by bringing the Eastern tribes into our fold can we create a strong foundation for our future."
 lha_purify_the_holy_city_title:0 "Purify the Holy City"
 lha_purify_the_holy_city_desc:0 "Though Lhasa stands as the seat of our monastic order, its people remain entrenched in the old ways of Bon. This contradiction weakens our authority and invites mockery from those who question our rule. If we are to truly lead Tibet into a new era of spiritual unity, we must cleanse Lhasa of its unorthodox beliefs and restore it as the beating heart of the Dharma. Only then can we wield the moral and political strength needed to shape the future of our land."

 lha_legacy_of_trisong_detsen_desc:0 "Long ago, the great Emperor Trisong Detsen led Tibet to unparalleled heights, forging an empire that stretched from the Himalayas to the borders of China and India. He was both a warrior and a devout patron of Buddhism, securing our faith’s place in Tibet while commanding armies that humbled even the mighty Tang Dynasty. But those days of unity and strength are long past—Tibet has fractured, its people divided by petty warlords and fading traditions.\nIf we are to honor the legacy of Trisong Detsen, we must reunite the Land of Snows under one banner before it is too late. The task is arduous, but history remembers only those who dared to shape its course."

Only then can we fulfill our sacred duty and guide our people toward enlightenment and strength."

However, its influence is still limited, and rival Buddhist sects and the old faith hold strong across Tibet. If we wish to see the Gelug teachings flourish, we must ensure our monasteries receive the support they need. Only by establishing great centers of learning and faith can we secure the future of our spiritual path and lay the foundations for the one true order in Tibet."

Our scholars and monks have scoured the land, following sacred omens and prophecies that point to the child who will bear the mantle of Avalokiteshvara. Once found, this holy ruler will bring legitimacy to our faith, cementing the rule of the monastic order and guiding Tibet toward an era of spiritual and worldly authority.

The people of Tibet rejoice as the rightful spiritual leader prepares to ascend to his place as both the earthly and divine guide of our nation. The monasteries welcome this moment as a sign of our faith’s triumph, while the nobility watches with wary eyes, uncertain of what this new era may bring. Now, as the sacred child is enthroned, a new chapter in Tibetan history begins—the rule of the Dalai Lama, as the head of both state and faith."

Now, as our influence spreads beyond the Tibetan Plateau, we cannot ignore its strategic and spiritual significance. With the shifting powers in Hindustan, securing Kashmir is vital—not only as a gateway to the fertile plains beyond but as a means to reclaim the lost Buddhist heritage buried beneath foreign rule. By taking control of this sacred land, we shall ensure that its mountain passes serve the Dharma once more, rather than the ambitions of those who seek to stifle it."

 lha_conquer_the_pahari_desc:0 "The rugged highlands of the Pahari region have long been a land of warriors and mystics, their isolated fortresses and hilltop monasteries standing as sentinels over the plains of Hindustan. Though divided among countless chieftains and petty rulers, these mountain folk are resilient and deeply entrenched in their ways. If we are to secure the southern approaches to the Tibetan Plateau, we must bring the Pahari under our rule—whether through diplomacy or by the sword. Once pacified, their strongholds will serve as bulwarks against foreign incursions, and their hardy warriors may yet prove invaluable in our future campaigns."
 lha_break_nepal_title:0 "Break Nepal"
 lha_break_nepal_desc:0 "For centuries, the Nepalese kingdoms have stood as a formidable barrier between Tibet and the fertile lands of the Indian subcontinent. Their rugged terrain and fiercely independent rulers have made them difficult to subjugate, but if we are to cement our dominance over the Himalayas, we must bring Nepal under our control.

Though they have embraced different paths—some following the ways of Theravada, others bound by the traditions of Confucian thought or even ancient pagan beliefs—their roots remain entwined with our own. We must extend our hand, not as conquerors, but as shepherds, guiding our lost brethren back into the fold of the Dharma and restoring them to their rightful place among the faithful."

By securing Sindh, Kalat, and the vital passes of Miani Hor, Bela, and Khuzdar, we will establish an unshakable boundary—one that shields the subcontinent from the ambitions of Persia and ensures that its future remains in the hands of those who walk the path of the Dharma.

Their scholars openly dismiss the sacred truth of his divine reincarnation, seeking to erode the spiritual unity of the Buddhist world. If left unchecked, they will only grow in strength, forming alliances that may one day threaten our mission to bring true enlightenment to all. Moreover, the prosperity of Bengal is undeniable. It is the beating heart of trade in the East, a crossroads where merchants, scholars, and pilgrims alike converge. In the wrong hands, this wealth will be turned against us. If we are to safeguard the Dharma and ensure that Buddhism flourishes under rightful leadership, we must act before their influence overshadows our own.

Yet under the rule of the Zunists and other heathens, they have been neglected, their presence tolerated but their significance forgotten.

But division within the Sangha weakens all who follow the Buddha's way.

Yet their rulers follow the misguided teachings of Theravada, rejecting the wisdom of Vajrayana and dismissing the sacred authority of the Dalai Lama. Their dominance has led to the oppression of Vajrayana believers within their lands, and their influence threatens to steer Southeast Asia further from the righteous path. We must strike down the Theravada stronghold, liberate its people from ignorance, and establish a new order where the light of Vajrayana shines across the land."

 lha_skin_the_naga_desc:0 "The kingdom of Lan Xang proclaims itself as the 'Land of a Million Elephants,' but its true power lies not in its beasts of burden, but in its deep-rooted spiritual traditions. Yet, their devotion is misled, their temples built in reverence of a flawed path. If we are to guide the people of the Mekong to true Enlightenment, we must strike at the heart of their misguided ways. By seizing their lands and dismantling their false idols, we will ensure that the waters of the Mekong flow with the Dharma, and that the Nāga of Lan Xang bows before the rightful Chakravartin."

 lha_break_the_kouprey_desc:0 "The once-mighty Khmer kingdom, like the elusive Kouprey, roams the lands of Indochina clinging to the remnants of its former glory. It has grown wild and directionless, ruled by monarchs who venerate broken gods and cling to dying traditions. Their refusal to embrace the path of true enlightenment leaves them lost in the jungle of ignorance. It is time to drive them out of the darkness, subdue their wayward rule, and bring the radiance of the Dharma to the lands of Angkor. The Kouprey shall be tamed, and Khmer shall kneel before the wisdom of the Supreme Spiritual Authority"
