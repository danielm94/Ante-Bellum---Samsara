 lha_sword_and_dharma_title:0 "The Sword and the Dharma"
 lha_sword_and_dharma_desc:0 "For too long, the sacred land of Tibet has been fractured, plagued by internal struggles and foreign influences. Though we are monks, we are also guardians of the faith. Under the guidance of our spiritual leaders, we must prepare our forces, for only through unity—both of mind and of strength—can we ensure the security of our monasteries and people. If we do not take up arms to protect the Dharma, who will?"
 lha_pacify_the_old_faith_title:0 "Pacify the Old Faith"
 lha_pacify_the_old_faith_desc:0 "The western regions of Tibet remain lost in the old ways, clinging to the teachings of Bön. Though our faith has spread far, many still follow the ancient rites and resist the truth of the Dharma. If we are to unify Tibet, we must bring the wayward western lords under our guidance—through diplomacy, faith, or force. Only then can Tibet truly be whole."
 lha_unite_the_faithful_title:0 "Unite the Faithful"
 lha_unite_the_faithful_desc:0 "The eastern reaches of Tibet remain fragmented, divided between Vajrayana Buddhist warlords and scattered tribal chieftains. Though they follow the Dharma, their ambitions and rivalries keep them divided. To truly unify Tibet, we must show them the wisdom of a single, united faith under Lhasa’s guidance. Only by bringing the Eastern tribes into our fold can we create a strong foundation for our future."
 lha_purify_the_holy_city_title:0 "Purify the Holy City"
 lha_purify_the_holy_city_desc:0 "Though Lhasa stands as the seat of our monastic order, its people remain entrenched in the old ways of Bon. This contradiction weakens our authority and invites mockery from those who question our rule. If we are to truly lead Tibet into a new era of spiritual unity, we must cleanse Lhasa of its unorthodox beliefs and restore it as the beating heart of the Dharma. Only then can we wield the moral and political strength needed to shape the future of our land."

 lha_legacy_of_trisong_detsen_title:0 "The Legacy of Trisong Detsen"
 lha_legacy_of_trisong_detsen_desc:0 "Long ago, the great Emperor Trisong Detsen led Tibet to unparalleled heights, forging an empire that stretched from the Himalayas to the borders of China and India. He was both a warrior and a devout patron of Buddhism, securing our faith’s place in Tibet while commanding armies that humbled even the mighty Tang Dynasty. But those days of unity and strength are long past—Tibet has fractured, its people divided by petty warlords and fading traditions.\nIf we are to honor the legacy of Trisong Detsen, we must reunite the Land of Snows under one banner before it is too late. The task is arduous, but history remembers only those who dared to shape its course."

 lha_tibet_unified_title:0 "Unify Tibet"
 lha_tibet_unified_desc:0 "For centuries, Tibet has been a land divided—its valleys and plateaus ruled by warring lords, its people split between faiths and rivaling monastic orders. Now, with our banners raised high, we stand on the precipice of destiny. To bring lasting peace and stability, we must forge a single, united Tibet under our rule. Only then can we fulfill our sacred duty and guide our people toward enlightenment and strength."
 lha_forge_alliances_title:0 "Forge Alliances"
 lha_forge_alliances_desc:0 "Isolation has long defined our land, nestled high in the mountains and guarded by the towering peaks of the Himalayas. Yet, no great endeavor is accomplished alone. If we are to secure the future of our realm and safeguard the Dharma, we must seek allies beyond our borders"

 lha_construct_temples_title:0 "Sanctify the Land"
 lha_construct_temples_desc:0 "The spiritual foundation of our realm must be strengthened.

 lha_develop_the_holy_city_title:0 "Develop the Holy City"
 lha_develop_the_holy_city_desc:0 "Lhasa, the beating heart of our faith, must reflect its divine purpose not only in spirit but in its splendor.

 lha_support_the_gelug_school_desc:0 "The Gelug school, founded by the great reformer Je Tsongkhapa, preaches strict monastic discipline and scholarly devotion to the Dharma. However, its influence is still limited, and rival Buddhist sects and the old faith hold strong across Tibet. If we wish to see the Gelug teachings flourish, we must ensure our monasteries receive the support they need. Only by establishing great centers of learning and faith can we secure the future of our spiritual path and lay the foundations for the one true order in Tibet."
 lha_crown_of_the_plateau_title:0 "Crown of the Plateau"
 lha_crown_of_the_plateau_desc:0 "Through careful stewardship and tireless dedication, Lhasa has flourished into a beacon of faith and prosperity. Yet, our ambitions must rise higher still. To truly cement our place as the heart of Tibetan civilization, we must refine our infrastructure, strengthen our economy, and ensure that our city is worthy of its divine legacy. When the monasteries stand firm, the markets thrive, and our people know no hardship, Lhasa shall be recognized as the true Crown of the Plateau, a city that radiates wisdom, wealth, and strength across the Himalayas and beyond."

 lha_find_the_dalai_lama_desc:0 "With Tibet united and the Gelug School firmly established, the time has come to seek out the divine reincarnation of the supreme spiritual leader. Our scholars and monks have scoured the land, following sacred omens and prophecies that point to the child who will bear the mantle of Avalokiteshvara. Once found, this holy ruler will bring legitimacy to our faith, cementing the rule of the monastic order and guiding Tibet toward an era of spiritual and worldly authority. The Dalai Lama must ascend—Tibet's destiny depends on it."

The people of Tibet rejoice as the rightful spiritual leader prepares to ascend to his place as both the earthly and divine guide of our nation. The monasteries welcome this moment as a sign of our faith’s triumph, while the nobility watches with wary eyes, uncertain of what this new era may bring. Now, as the sacred child is enthroned, a new chapter in Tibetan history begins—the rule of the Dalai Lama, as the head of both state and faith."

Yet, among them, many have looked to the wisdom of the Lamas for guidance, and a bond of faith has begun to form between our peoples.

 lha_moving_through_kashmir_desc:0 "Kashmir, the fabled land of scholars and sages, was once a bastion of Buddhist learning before centuries of turmoil reshaped its identity. Now, as our influence spreads beyond the Tibetan Plateau, we cannot ignore its strategic and spiritual significance. With the shifting powers in Hindustan, securing Kashmir is vital—not only as a gateway to the fertile plains beyond but as a means to reclaim the lost Buddhist heritage buried beneath foreign rule. By taking control of this sacred land, we shall ensure that its mountain passes serve the Dharma once more, rather than the ambitions of those who seek to stifle it."
 lha_conquer_the_pahari_title:0 "Conquer the Pahari"
 lha_conquer_the_pahari_desc:0 "The rugged highlands of the Pahari region have long been a land of warriors and mystics, their isolated fortresses and hilltop monasteries standing as sentinels over the plains of Hindustan. Though divided among countless chieftains and petty rulers, these mountain folk are resilient and deeply entrenched in their ways. If we are to secure the southern approaches to the Tibetan Plateau, we must bring the Pahari under our rule—whether through diplomacy or by the sword. Once pacified, their strongholds will serve as bulwarks against foreign incursions, and their hardy warriors may yet prove invaluable in our future campaigns."
 lha_break_nepal_title:0 "Break Nepal"
 lha_break_nepal_desc:0 "For centuries, the Nepalese kingdoms have stood as a formidable barrier between Tibet and the fertile lands of the Indian subcontinent. Their rugged terrain and fiercely independent rulers have made them difficult to subjugate, but if we are to cement our dominance over the Himalayas, we must bring Nepal under our control. By integrating these mountain strongholds into our realm, we will not only secure vital trade routes but also gain access to the legendary warriors of the Hill Clans, whose martial prowess will serve us well in the struggles to come."

 lha_the_lost_bretheren_desc:0 "For centuries, the peoples of the highlands and river valleys beyond our eastern borders have shared deep cultural and historical ties with Tibet. Though they have embraced different paths—some following the ways of Theravada, others bound by the traditions of Confucian thought or even ancient pagan beliefs—their roots remain entwined with our own. We must extend our hand, not as conquerors, but as shepherds, guiding our lost brethren back into the fold of the Dharma and restoring them to their rightful place among the faithful."

Now, these lands are threatened by outside powers, leaving our co-religionists vulnerable and our influence in peril. By reasserting our rightful claim over the Tarim, we secure both the Silk Road and the spiritual well-being of those who still look to Lhasa for guidance."

Once the Hill Clans stand together as one, our realm shall be stronger than ever"

By uniting these lands under our banner, we not only protect the faithful who share our path but also secure a vital foothold for future expansion.

Yet, as foreign powers press eastward, seeking to impose their influence upon the rich and diverse peoples of Hindustan, we must act decisively. By securing Sindh, Kalat, and the vital passes of Miani Hor, Bela, and Khuzdar, we will establish an unshakable boundary—one that shields the subcontinent from the ambitions of Persia and ensures that its future remains in the hands of those who walk the path of the Dharma. With the Indus as our guardian and our armies standing firm, we shall dictate the course of history in this land."

Though we have long maintained ties with the steppe, it was not so long ago that they subjugated us. Now, they rule through plunder and devastation, and they set their gaze toward India. Given time, they will grow in strength and return their wrath upon us once more. We are not warmongers, but the sword is sometimes necessary to prevent greater suffering.
