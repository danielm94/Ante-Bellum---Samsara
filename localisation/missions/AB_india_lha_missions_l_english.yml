 lha_sword_and_dharma_desc:0 "For too long, the sacred land of Tibet has been fractured, plagued by internal struggles and foreign influences. Though we are monks, we are also guardians of the faith. Under the guidance of our spiritual leaders, we must prepare our forces, for only through unity—both of mind and of strength—can we ensure the security of our monasteries and people. If we do not take up arms to protect the Dharma, who will?"
 lha_pacify_the_old_faith_title:0 "Pacify the Old Faith"
 lha_pacify_the_old_faith_desc:0 "The western regions of Tibet remain lost in the old ways, clinging to the teachings of Bön. Though our faith has spread far, many still follow the ancient rites and resist the truth of the Dharma. If we are to unify Tibet, we must bring the wayward western lords under our guidance—through diplomacy, faith, or force. Only then can Tibet truly be whole."
 lha_unite_the_faithful_title:0 "Unite the Faithful"
 lha_unite_the_faithful_desc:0 "The eastern reaches of Tibet remain fragmented, divided between Vajrayana Buddhist warlords and scattered tribal chieftains. Though they follow the Dharma, their ambitions and rivalries keep them divided. To truly unify Tibet, we must show them the wisdom of a single, united faith under Lhasa’s guidance. Only by bringing the Eastern tribes into our fold can we create a strong foundation for our future."

 lha_purify_the_holy_city_desc:0 "Though Lhasa stands as the seat of our monastic order, its people remain entrenched in the old ways of Bon. This contradiction weakens our authority and invites mockery from those who question our rule. If we are to truly lead Tibet into a new era of spiritual unity, we must cleanse Lhasa of its unorthodox beliefs and restore it as the beating heart of the Dharma. Only then can we wield the moral and political strength needed to shape the future of our land."

 lha_legacy_of_trisong_detsen_desc:0 "Long ago, the great Emperor Trisong Detsen led Tibet to unparalleled heights, forging an empire that stretched from the Himalayas to the borders of China and India. He was both a warrior and a devout patron of Buddhism, securing our faith’s place in Tibet while commanding armies that humbled even the mighty Tang Dynasty. But those days of unity and strength are long past—Tibet has fractured, its people divided by petty warlords and fading traditions.\nIf we are to honor the legacy of Trisong Detsen, we must reunite the Land of Snows under one banner before it is too late. The task is arduous, but history remembers only those who dared to shape its course."

Only then can we fulfill our sacred duty and guide our people toward enlightenment and strength."

However, its influence is still limited, and rival Buddhist sects and the old faith hold strong across Tibet. If we wish to see the Gelug teachings flourish, we must ensure our monasteries receive the support they need. Only by establishing great centers of learning and faith can we secure the future of our spiritual path and lay the foundations for the one true order in Tibet."

 lha_crown_of_the_plateau_desc:0 "Through careful stewardship and tireless dedication, Lhasa has flourished into a beacon of faith and prosperity. Yet, our ambitions must rise higher still.

When the monasteries stand firm, the markets thrive, and our people know no hardship, Lhasa shall be recognized as the true Crown of the Plateau, a city that radiates wisdom, wealth, and strength across the Himalayas and beyond."

Our scholars and monks have scoured the land, following sacred omens and prophecies that point to the child who will bear the mantle of Avalokiteshvara. Once found, this holy ruler will bring legitimacy to our faith, cementing the rule of the monastic order and guiding Tibet toward an era of spiritual and worldly authority.
