 abindia_shitevent.1.t:0 "What do you think you're doing?"
 abindia_shitevent.1.d:0 "In case you haven't noticed, this nation isn't supposed to be played by the player. \n \nParmistan is a meme tag added as a placeholder to replace Timurid Empire before the upcoming Ante Bellum Persia Update. The non-existance of Timurid nation is vital for the India Expansion mod's lore, therefore such decision was made. \n \nAs this nation is just a placeholder, do not expect any flavour content besides what you've already seen. No unique events nor goals. \n \nIf you realized your mistake, please reload the game and try to play actual nation instead. \n \nYou're still reading this aren't you? Listen, it's an empty tag to fill in the void left by necessary removal of Timurids. That's it. AI is supposed to play this nation for a while and then (hopefully) get conquered before disrupting the balance of cosmos. \n \nThis isn't lore-accurate at all. Stop looking. \n \nOh, you're reading till the end expecting some sort of crazy twist? Nuh uh... \n \nCome on, just return to the main menu. That's it! You've made a mistake. Time to move on. \n \n... \n \nThe code to immortality orb is 2751094"

 #Mission events
 abindia_mission.1.t:0 "Expedition to Lakshadweeps"
 abindia_mission.1.d:0 "To the north of Maldives lies another chain of tiny islands known as Lakshadweeps. Those tiny rocks west of Malabar coast were known and inhabited by the locals since antiquity. Due to their size and insignificane, nobody has yet made any effort of establishing permanent rule over there. For centuries islands served as stop and resupply hub for merchants and travellers. The locals, despite adopting Islam thanks to Ubaidullah in 661 CE, still live in free stateless society. As our pirate republic seeks expansion, claiming those islands for the black flag would be a perfect beginning. Not to mention that once within our hands, those islands would make a perfect naval base to organize pirate raids on Western Indian Coast. \nIntegrating the islands permanently to our republic won't be an easy task though. Land there is mostly empty and unsustainable. First settlers to arrive there to establish administrative structures would require constant flow of supplies from Maldives before building enough infrastructure to support basic fishing economy.But once it's done, we can expect it to serve as excellent naval base. It is a mission worth consideration."
 abindia_mission.1.a:0 "The islands belong to the pirates!"
 abindia_mission.1.tooltip:0 "We will send our men to establish permanent outpost on Lakshadweeps Archipelago. Our chances of success will be the highest if we can protect ourselves from the unhappy locals."
 abindia_mission.1.b:0 "We could use eager men somewhere else"
 abindia_mission.2.t:0 "Status of Sri Lanka"
 abindia_mission.2.d:0 "Recently, we've greatly expanded our realm from small archipelago to sizeable island of Sri Lanka. Terrirories of which reach deep indland, which may pose difficulties in governing it as a pirate state. We must also consider native population living on the island and local noble class which definetely will not be happy with our radical anti-monarchic views. Shall we liberate the population from their masters or let them remain slaves to their overlords? Shall we directly control the land for future exploitation or leave it to its own and only set on the coast? We must decide before we continue our endeavours."
 abindia_mission.2.a:0 "Keep the status quo"
 abindia_mission.2.b:0 "Liberate its people and occupy the island"
 abindia_mission.2.c:0 "Take ports and establish puppet state elsewhere"

 abindia_mission.3.d:0 "Our pirate republic has successfully overwhelmed malankara christians on Malabar coast and managed to run-sack most of the coastal ports. The cherry on top being the capture of Villarvattom - largest and most developed port in Southern India, which also serves as most important holy city for malankara christians. City of great splendor, now within our hands. Its riches within our reach. Our boys are hungry for 'yer booty, so how shall we treat our new posession?"

 abindia_mission.4.d:0 "With the recent conquest of Hormuz and development on the island, the place grown prominent and its importance becomes more and more significant.

Suggestions to abandon our poor old capital and move royal court there recently become louder and louder, especially after we've finished construction of new important buildings on the island."
 abindia_mission.4.a:0 "Sultan of Oman lives in Hormuz now"
 abindia_mission.4.b:0 "It will serve better as a fortress"
 abindia_mission.5.t:0 "The Question of Slavery"
 abindia_mission.5.d:0 "As our trade influence over India grows and we gain access to its ports, we must face an important decision. For centuries our muslim nation practised slavery and had a fair share in slave trade market. Now with many ports in India under our control and heathen Indian population within our reach, we are facking a possibility of expanding slave market to scale our nation hadn't seen before. \nSuch high access to new slaves could elevate our nation to brand new position of mercantile and economic powerhouse. The others say that we are simply not ready to face slave market this size and its scale will simply overwhelm us. That we are not prepared nor even aware of the future consequences such reliance of slave workforce would cause. Our venture into India should not be one of mass exploitation as it can very easily backfire. \nOne way or another, a decision must be made."
 abindia_mission.5.a:0 "New age of slave trade begins now"
 abindia_mission.5.tooltip:0 "We decided to invest fully in slave trade from India and possibilities it gives. We will continue our path with §YSlave Empire§! mission branch."

Unhappy servants seek to dismantle remaining state' assets before foreign powers swoop in and do the same. \nDark period rolls over Gujarat nation."
 abindia_mission.6.a:0 "The end is nigh!"
 abindia_mission.6.b:0 "The economy fools!"
 abindia_mission.7.t:0 "Question of Alhindi Settlers"
 abindia_mission.7.d:0 "We have secured all holdings in Lanka that once belonged to Hormuzi Trade Company. While most of this land consists of our native people, there are some places where extensive arabic settlement has occured, effectively turning parts of the island into new home for the Alhindi (Indian Arabs). Puttalam and to some extend Kotte, feature foreign muslim influence. With the land secured, we must now decide what we do about those foreign colonizers. Their knowledge and skills may be useful to us but can they really be trusted?"

 abindia_mission.7.b:0 "They are allowed to stay"
 abindia_mission.8.t:0 "New goods in Lanka"
 abindia_mission.8.d:0 "Province of Puttalam has been focused mainly on basic agriculture to supply our own population with food. Recent expansion of plantations on Lanka opens new possibility for modernization of said province. Poorly-used land seems perfect for introduction of new, more profitable plants. Opening up new market of domestically-produced goods could grand Lanka its share in regional trade of such goods and introduce new competitor to the global market. We shall just fighure out which goods we want to invest in."

 #Flavour for Sri Lanka
 abindia_lankan_event.1.t:0 "Looming Upheaval"
 abindia_lankan_event.1.d:0 "Vanni Tribes living in the jungles to the south of our most developed regions have always been causing trouble for the mercantile-oriented state. Poorly developed and disconnected from the capital, local chieftains have been gradually distancing themselves from the rulers in Jaffna. Since the nation has been realistically subjugated after seeking protection from mighty Chola kingdom, plots of secession began to spread among dissatisfied tribes. Rumors of upcoming uprising taint jaffnan court. Dark times surely form ahead of Jaffna, which only gods know the outcome of."

 #Flavour for Teligana/Reddy
 abindia_teligana_event.1.t:0 "Reddy of Teligana"
 abindia_teligana_event.1.d:0 "Reddy, sometimes called Raddi, Reddi or Reddappa, is a widespread Hindu caste centered around Andhra and Teligana regions. They are classified as forward caste, meaning they are on average considered ahead of other castes both economically and educationally. Access to higher standards of living allowed them to establish themselves deep within the administrative, mercatile and military structures of the region. The origin of the Reddy has been linked to the Rashtrakutas, although strength of that claim varies. They are feudal overlords and peasant proprietors. Traditionally, they are a diverse community of merchants and cultivators. Their prowess as rulers and warriors is well documented in Telugu history. \n \nReddy Kingdom existed briefly two times in the past. From 1322 to 1351 as mongol client state and from 1399 to 1417 as rump state of falling Kakatiya Empire. Conquered in 1417 by briefly resurgent Kakatiya and then split between Eastern Chalukyas and rising Teligana state. Reddy intertwined themselves with Telugu rulers, gradually gaining immense influence within Teligana. In the middle of 15th century, they are 2nd ruling class within Teligana with strength that may soon grow beyond Teligana's comprehension."

 abindia_teligana_event.2.t:0 "Reddy Caste Demand Privileges"
 abindia_teligana_event.2.d:0 "Taking advantage of their immense position and great influence over most spheres of government, Reddy elite demands a set of new privileges to be grante to them.

 abindia_teligana_event.3.t:0 "Outlandish Proposal"
 abindia_teligana_event.3.d:0 "Our Raja Lingama is getting older but nothing heralds that he will soon have a rightful heir. Some people are even speculating some sort of illness prevents him from having an offspring. Nonetheless, Reddy nobles have struck us with scandalous offer. \nThe most recent gathering of Reddy and our Royal Court debated the possibility of signing an agreement. The agreement would formalize the Teligana's succession in case the king dies without an offspring. Mutual pact for a king's lifetime would place noble from Reddi dynasty on the throne in case Lingama fails to produce a son. In addition, Reddy promise their loyal support and political benefits whether pact comes to fruition. At the end though, the final decision rests in the hands of the king."

 abindia_teligana_event.3.b:0 "Those sly dogs, our nation won't be overwhelmed"
 abindia_teligana_event.4.t:0 "Reddy Military Aid Offer"
 abindia_teligana_event.4.d:0 "Seeing that we are occupied with important wars with our rival nation, Reddy caste within our military structures offer us additional support. Agreeing to those privileges would definetely aid our troops but at the obvious cost. It is unlear whether Reddy sent this offer sincerely or it's a scheme to gain extra power."
 abindia_teligana_event.4.a:0 "We really need that aid"
 abindia_teligana_event.4.a.tooltip:0 "§YReddy influence over the state increases§!"
 abindia_teligana_event.4.b:0 "Our army is strong enough"
 abindia_teligana_event.5.t:0 "Formalize the succession now?"
 abindia_teligana_event.5.d:0 "Lingama - our king - is suffering from a flu, his body is getting older. So far he failed to produce an offspring and rumors that he never will, are getting louder as time moves on. In a dire situation, it may be time to accept the fate of the dynasty and announce Reddy noble as heir to the Teligana throne already. Such move may not be just but what else can we hope for?"
 abindia_teligana_event.5.a:0 "Announce him as proper heir"
 abindia_teligana_event.5.a.tooltip:0 "We will empower the previously-signed pact. Now the Reddi noble has been officially designated as our successor. \n \n§OBy this point you should be able to form Reddy Kingdom with your current ruler if you also increased Reddy influence via previous events.§!"

 abindia_teligana_event.6.t:0 "Honoring an Agreement"
 abindia_teligana_event.6.d:0 "Our king has died without an heir of his dynasty! May his sould rest now. Royal assembly was called for. It is now duty of highest telugu officials to honor signed agreement with Reddy nobility and crown their delegate as the new ruler of Teligana. Previous king has made a promise we now are obligated to respect... unless?"

 abindia_teligana_event.6.b.tooltip:0 "§YBy refusing to respect the legitimate agreement, we will greatly outrage Reddy caste. Denied their right, they will rebel to push their rightful claims and place Reddi ruler on the throne by force.§!"
 abindia_teligana_event.7.t:0 "Curtail Reddy Influence"
 abindia_teligana_event.7.d:0 "After a lot of pressure from Reddy and many failed proposals, we have remained steadfast against their advances. With enough power within our government, we can finally push down their ambitions and debate all the privileges they've previously enforced on us."
 abindia_teligana_event.7.a:0 "There is no need to hurry"
 abindia_teligana_event.7.b:0 "Time to curb their influence for good"
