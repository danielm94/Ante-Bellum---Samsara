Mongol invasion, followed soon after the ceompletion of this great site, completely shattered the ambitions of Hind to spread zoroastrianism even further, although the Mongols left temple monstly intact. Following the collapse of Black Khanate in 14th century, Jains from Sindh ended up in posession of the site, which was the cause of many border wars with recovering Hind. Nonetheless, Sidh allowed for zoroastrian worship as so, the site still attracts large number of pilgrims from all around.

It's one high stone wall broken by towers, small castles and garrison camps. It's permanently staffed by its own military force. - 2. The further and support line spanning in total of 80km, 45km of which is the continuation of the main wall extending south and northeast. The rest forms additional fortified positions around Peshawar town to guard it from surprise attack from other sides. This part, although still fully guarded, is much more univen and not impenetrable. High wall gives way to mixed stone-clay-eart structures and main defence is centered around outposts. - 3. Outer outposts and blockades scattered around mountain ranges and valleys up to 100km northwest and southwest are to guard flanks and deter armies from attempting a risky flanking maneuver. - 4. Forward defence placed westwards consisting of many watchpoints but mainly of expendable traps and obstacles meant to be used to attrition the incoming enemy.§!"
