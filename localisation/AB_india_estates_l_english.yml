 estate_tamil_guilds_desc:0 "Tamil Guilds are present throughout all of Tamil Nandu region but their influence streatches much further. For centuries, they have been a dominant merchant caste in all of Coromandel, amassing great wealth from commerce. Tamils have found many guilds, on the coast and in central lands, focused on exchanging and producting exotic goods that are then shipped west, towards the Middle East. Naval and economic strength the Tamil guilds hold over the region, allowed them to elevate themselves above lower merchants and establish themselves as commercial and political powerhouse that must be reckoned with."
