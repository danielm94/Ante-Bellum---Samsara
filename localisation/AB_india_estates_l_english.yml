 estate_tamil_guilds_desc:0 "Tamil Guilds are present throughout all of Tamil Nandu region but their influence streatches much further. For centuries, they have been a dominant merchant caste in all of Coromandel, amassing great wealth from commerce. Tamils have found many guilds, on the coast and in central lands, focused on exchanging and producting exotic goods that are then shipped west, towards the Middle East. Naval and economic strength the Tamil guilds hold over the region, allowed them to elevate themselves above lower merchants and establish themselves as commercial and political powerhouse that must be reckoned with."

 estate_tamil_guilds_allow_private_armies:0 "Allow Tamil Private Armies"
 estate_tamil_guilds_allow_private_armies_desc:0 "Tamil Guilds have to face many threats while conducting their business. Whether it is pirates, robbers, enemy bands, privateers or rowdy citizens, it is the duty of the state to protect its merchants. Since Tamil Guilds have always been capable and powerful, we can allow them to recruit and upkeep small army forces, loyal to them, so that they may protect themselves from threats. This way Tamils can enforce order locally more effectively than central state and we won't have to invest so heavily in guarrison checks. On the other hand, allowing a powerful estate to hire private military will grant them massive leverage and may lead to consequences if we aren't careful."
